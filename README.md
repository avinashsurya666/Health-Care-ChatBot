# Medical Chatbot

This repository contains a Medical Chatbot that provides responses to medical-related queries by leveraging an LLM model. It utilizes Llama (LLM) and integrates with medical knowledge databases for precise and helpful responses. The project is structured for ease of use, and it is designed for deployment in healthcare-related applications.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The chatbot can interpret and answer medical questions with accuracy.
- **Powered by Llama LLM:** Using the powerful Llama model to generate responses based on medical data.
- **Chunking via Hugging Face:** Ensures efficient data handling by dividing medical encyclopedia content into manageable chunks for the LLM.
- **Contextual Answers:** Provides contextual and relevant responses based on the user's medical queries.
- **Medical Encyclopedia:** Knowledge is sourced from a comprehensive medical encyclopedia, allowing the bot to give expert medical information.

## How it Works

1. **Data Sourcing:** Medical data is obtained from a structured medical encyclopedia.
2. **Data Chunking:** The data is divided into chunks using Hugging Face to ensure efficient processing by the LLM.
3. **Model Interaction:** Llama LLM processes the queries and provides accurate, context-aware responses.
4. **Response Generation:** The chatbot uses the chunked data to generate answers to medical-related questions in real-time.
